# Bibi-binary System: Missing Pagination Found After 54 Years

## Discovery
Original documentation of Boby Lapointe's Bibi-binary system located:
- Pages 225-237 in "Les cerveaux non-humains" (1970)
- First academic publication of this hexadecimal phonetic system
- Invented by French singer-mathematician Boby Lapointe (patent FR1569028, 1968)

## Why This Matters
- Revolutionary hexadecimal notation using pronounceable syllables
- Predates modern hexadecimal conventions
- Missing pagination prevented proper academic citations for 54 years
